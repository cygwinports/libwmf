ldesc: "libwmf is a library for reading vector images in Microsoft's
native Windows Metafile Format (WMF) and for either (a) displaying them
in, e.g., an X window; or (b) converting them to more standard/open file
formats such as, e.g., the W3C's XML-based Scaleable Vector Graphic
(SVG) format. Currently bindings exist for conversion to vector image
formats EPS, PS, FIG, SVG, and raster image formats PNG and JPEG."
